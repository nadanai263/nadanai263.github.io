I am a biophysicist by training. For me, living organisms represents some of the most complex, beautiful, and mysterious systems in existence. Somehow they seem to defy the clean, mathematical descriptions of the universe taught to us in physics. And yet, like everything else, biological systems are goverened by physical laws, and we should be able to describe them using mathematics. This simple idea is difficult on so many levels: how can we write down simple equations to describe such a complex system? Even if we break down the problem into smaller, managable sections, is it possible to combine everything into a unified picture which is simple enough to be understood? Is it fruitful to search within these systems for any sort of new physics which can unify the descriptions? I take inspiration from biophysicists such as [Bill Bialek](http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/wbialek.html), who searches for these unifying principles. 

A concrete way to obtain at least some intuition about biology is to break it down and then build it up again. This is the domain of synthetic biology. If we can reverse as well as forward-engineer a biological system, we may be able to understand more about what problems they must overcome to operate reliably.
