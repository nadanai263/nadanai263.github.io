Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing field set to make profound impact in numerous industries including manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and sustainable energy, as well as our fundamental understanding of life itself. However, engineering synthetic biological systems reliably has proven to be a tremendously challenging task.

One promising approach is to use cell-free gene expression systems. These are *in vitro* systems that mimic the cellular environment and can be integrated with microfluidic technologies to rapidly prototype and screen synthetic gene circuits, prior to their deployment *in vivo*. This speeds up the synthetic biology design cycle, but also perhaps more powerfully, releases gene expression from the confines of the cell. In this way, the cell-free extracts themselves can be viewed as functional liquids, programmed by DNA.

**The aim of our research is to harness these *in vitro* biomolecular mechanisms in a controlled and quantitative manner.**

The consequence of this approach is twofold: the first is a deeper understanding of life, as we attempt to control and manipulate genetic and metabolic systems which have been crafted over billions of years of evolution. The second is the development of powerful cell-free applications which, unlike synthetic cellular systems, are not limited by the strict requirements to maintain life.

<h3>PhD Opportunities</h3>

A new studentship has just been advertised as part of the IBioIC CTP programme, to start by 30 September 2021, between ours and Chris French's [lab](http://frenchlab.bio.ed.ac.uk), and in collaboration with the Scotch Whisky Research Institute. The aim is to develop cell-free biosensors to monitor whisky quality. Funding is available for UK or EU students resident in the UK for 3 years prior to start of studentship. More info and apply [here](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/development-of-biosensor-technology-for-the-measurement-and-control-of-off-note-flavours-in-the-scotch-whisky-industry/?p130850) by the deadline of 9th April 2021.

Title: **Development of biosensor technology for the measurement and control of off-note flavours in the Scotch Whisky industry**

This project is a collaboration with the Scotch Whisky Research Institute ([SWRI](https://www.swri.co.uk/)). The aim of the project is to investigate the potential of developing biosensor-based technology to identify and quantify compounds present in whiskies that would be perceived as off-notes by the consumer, with the aim of developing rapid quality control techniques that could be used in the production environment.

Since flavour is the primary driver of consumer acceptability in Scotch Whisky, it is vital that the industry monitors, controls and optimises the flavour of their products. Currently the industry takes two approaches to the measurement of flavour, chemical analysis (eg, GCMS) and sensory evaluation by trained human assessors. Analytical methods fail to account for the effects of mixtures of compounds, and may lack the required sensitivity, whereas human assessment has an unavoidable level of variability.

This project will explore biological measurements which mimic actual perception of flavour, focusing on the development of specific biosensors for the detection of the main off-note flavours that can develop as whisky matures in oak casks. To be useful, the biosensor device must be sensitive, specific, and give a rapid response at the point of use, without requiring samples to be transferred to a laboratory. Transcriptional biosensors rely on the response of genetic promoter elements to particular molecules. Sensors based on live cells can not be used outside a laboratory setting, but this can be overcome by the use of cell-free transcription-translation (TX/TL) systems, or even simpler transcription-only (TXO) systems, which are simple, cheap, and can give responses visible by eye within minutes (Millacura et al, 2020).

This project aims to develop biosensors of this type to detect four classes of compounds: ‘musty’ (anisoles, especially 2,4,6-trichloroanisole); ‘sour’ (acetic acid); ‘solvent’ (ethyl acetate); and ‘phenolic’ (phenols and cresols). This requires discovery of suitably responsive promoters and introducing them into TX/TL and TXO systems for evaluation. Where known promoters exist which respond to the desired targets, these may be synthesised and tested against pure compounds and then samples supplied by SWRI. Secondly, various bacteria will be exposed to vapours of the target chemicals to empirically determine which promoters are activated. Promising promoters will be further improved through directed evolution. In parallel with this, an improved sensor format will be developed which is suitable for the testing environment. Such a platform could also be valuable in many other applications.

The successful candidate will be able to liaise with whisky producers, with SWRI providing industry contacts and a forum to present and discuss results. Additionally they will join a cohort of students within the IBioIC PhD training programme, as well as the interdisciplinary Centre for Synthetic and Systems Biology (SynthSys), where they will be encouraged to make full use of the expertise and world-class facilities available, to gain in-depth training in relevant experimental techniques and transferable skills to support their future career development.
