Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing field set to make profound impact in numerous industries including manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and sustainable energy, as well as our fundamental understanding of life itself. However, engineering synthetic biological systems reliably has proven to be a tremendously challenging task.

One promising approach is to use cell-free gene expression systems. These are *in vitro* systems that mimic the cellular environment and can be integrated with microfluidic technologies to rapidly prototype and screen synthetic gene circuits, prior to their deployment *in vivo*. This speeds up the synthetic biology design cycle, but also perhaps more powerfully, releases gene expression from the confines of the cell. In this way, the cell-free extracts themselves can be viewed as functional liquids, programmed by DNA.

**The aim of our research is to harness these *in vitro* biomolecular mechanisms in a controlled and quantitative manner.**

The consequence of this approach is twofold: the first is a deeper understanding of life, as we attempt to control and manipulate genetic and metabolic systems which have been crafted over billions of years of evolution. The second is the development of powerful cell-free applications which, unlike synthetic cellular systems, are not limited by the strict requirements to maintain life.

<h3>PhD Opportunities</h3>

**4-year, fully-funded EASTBIO studentship - 'Scalable cell-free manufacturing of diverse therapeutic proteins'**. The application deadline has now passed.

The aim of this project is to develop cell-free systems which are capable of producing a diverse range of therapeutically-relevant proteins, and investigate how they might be scaled up in an industrial setting. The PhD will be performed in partnership with [Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies UK (FDBK)](https://fujifilmdiosynth.com/).

We are also recruiting PhD students for an **October 2021** start, for projects related to metabolic engineering, automation, and computational modelling using cell-free systems. If you are interested in opportunities to work with us please send a CV, cover letter, and the names of two referees directly to [Nadanai](mailto:nadanai.laohakunakorn@ed.ac.uk).
