  * 26 Nov 2018 » [Cross validation](/pages/datascience/xval.html) The aim of cross-validation is to hold out a part of the training set, which is then used to evaluate the model's performance. Because this held-out data is not seen by the model during training, the evaluation provides an estimate of how well the model will generalise to the unseen test set. This tutorial shows how to implement cross-validation using Keras.

  * 24 Nov 2018 » [Metrics for binary classification](/pages/datascience/metrics.html) In this tutorial we will look at how to evaluate a classifier. To keep things simple, we won't look at details of the classifier itself, but we'll assume that we already have a working model, and consider how we might evaluate its performance. I'll explain some useful metrics including precision, recall, and the F1 score.

  * 21 Nov 2018 » [Hello Tensorflow](/pages/datascience/tensorflow.html) Tensorflow is a standard and powerful framework to build models for machine learning. Even though its power can already be harnessed using high-level, user-friendly wrappers such as Keras, it is also instructive to dive into the nuts and bolts of how it works. In this tutorial I will show you the most essential elements which make up a Tensorflow model, and how you can quickly build and train a linear regression predictor using these simple parts.

  * 19 Nov 2018 » [Introduction to Keras](/pages/datascience/keras.html) Keras is a high-level wrapper for Tensorflow and Theano, both of which are powerful machine learning frameworks, and for many people it is their first contact with deep learning. In this first tutorial, I present the most basic introduction to Keras, and develop a code framework which we'll recycle in later tutorials covering more advanced topics. 

  * 15 Nov 2018 » [Getting LinkedIn Data with Python](/pages/datascience/linkedin.html) In the same way as for Twitter, we can also get data from LinkedIn. Here I show how to interface with LinkedIn's API to access their data. 

  * 14 Nov 2018 » [Getting Twitter Data with Python](/pages/datascience/twitter.html) A journey of a million steps begins with one... and so I begin my with my first post in the world of data science! In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to scrape, or obtain, data from Twitter, and do some simple analysis on the results.
