*This paper demonstrates the use of high-throughput, integrated microfluidic devices for characterising the biophysical properties of cell-free gene regulation. We used the device to rapidly characterise a synthetic repressor library, and the results were used to direct the development of strong, cooperative repressors which were assembled to create logic gates in cell-free gene circuits.* Featured in [EPFL news](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/engineering-cellular-function-without-living-cel-3/).

*Conical nanopores exhibit ionic current and electroosmotic flow rectification, both arising from the same phenomenon of ionic permselectivity, which was elucidated in this computational study. Flow rectification is an important function in microfluidic circuits which is typically difficult to achieve due to the linearity of low Reynolds number flows.*

*We discovered that an electroosmotic jet driven from the tip of a nanocapillary sets up a large scale fluid flow whose pattern corresponds to a Landau-Squire stokeslet. The mathematical properties of the flow field allowed us to determine precisely the very small flow rate from the pore itself.*

*We used single-molecule measurements of DNA molecules tethered between a nanopore and an optical trap to elucidate the electrokinetic forces acting on DNA molecules in confinement, which is important for controlling their translocation through the pore.*

*We used the sudden release of DNA tethered between a nanopore and an optical trap to probe its relaxation dynamics, which is dominated by hydrodynamic friction along the length of the molecule. The observations are in agreement with an exact analytical theory.*
