			<p><b>Dr Nadanai Laohakunakorn</b>, originally from Bangkok, obtained his BA/MSci in Natural Sciences (Physics) from Trinity College, Cambridge in 2010. He remained in Cambridge to carry out his PhD under the supervision of <a href="http://people.bss.phy.cam.ac.uk/~ufk20/">Prof Ulrich Keyser</a>, where he studied nanopores and single-molecule biophysics. In particular, his work focused on electrically-driven fluid flows generated within the confined geometries of nanopores, and he developed techniques to measure and characterise these effects using optical tweezers. After defending his thesis in 2015, he moved to Lausanne where he worked with <a href="http://lbnc.epfl.ch/">Prof Sebastian Maerkl</a> at EPFL, on the new and growing field of cell-free synthetic biology. His work there focused on combining microfluidic devices with cell-free gene expression systems for high-throughput and rapid prototyping of genetic parts and circuits. In 2019 he received a Chancellor's Fellowship in Biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh, where he has established a lab for quantitative and automated engineering of cell-free systems.</p>

				<p><b>Ying Yang</b> is a masters student in biotechnology. Before graduating from Xiangya Medical School, China, she found an interest in synthetic biology, and represented her team in iGEM 2018. Inspired by this experience, Ying is motivated to work in Dr. Laohakunakorn's group, to develop a cell-free biosensor for iGEM 2020. Ying's current project is using computational metabolic models to investigate strategies for TX/TL system optimisation.</p>

				<p><b>Yehezkiel Victorio</b> is fascinated by the intricacies of bacterial life, especially the molecular mechanisms governing different functions in the bacterial cell. After graduating with both Bachelors (Microbiology) and Masters (Biotechnology) degrees from Institut Teknologi Bandung under the supervision of Dr. Maelita R. Moeis, Yehezkiel is now pursuing his second masters as a Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology student at the University of Edinburgh. Yehezkiel is currently working in Dr Laohakunakorn's lab for his dissertation project, on a bioinformatics study of the <i>E. coli</i> cell-free system.</p>

				<p><b>Baird McIlwraith</b> grew up in the Scottish Borders, and is a 4th year biological science undergraduate. He specialises in Molecular Genetics, and would like to progress into bioinformatics and cancer research. He is currently working in Dr Laohakunakorn's lab group in developing an updated version of GeneNet, an algorithm which uses AI and machine learning to predict gene networks within a cell, given a gene expression profile.</p>
