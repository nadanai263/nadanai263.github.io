  * 29 Nov 2018 » [ClosestPair](/pages/algorithms/closestpair.html) This is a more involved example of a divide and conquer algorithm; it uses results of MergeSort as well a trick to calculate only a small number of split pairs, or pairs of points from either side of the divide. 

  * 29 Nov 2018 » [Strassen](/pages/algorithms/strassen.html) Strassen's magical algorithm beats the standard matrix multiplication because it computes seven, instead of eight independent operations at each recursive call. How did he come up with it? No one knows!

  * 29 Nov 2018 » [CountInversions](/pages/algorithms/countinversions.html) The number of inversions in an array can be counted with a simple modification of MergeSort.

  * 29 Nov 2018 » [SelectionSort](/pages/algorithms/selectionsort.html) This is a simple but inefficient sorting algorithm, compared to MergeSort.

  * 29 Nov 2018 » [MergeSort](/pages/algorithms/mergesort.html) This is the canonical example of a recursive divide and conquer algorithm. It recursively divides the input array, resulting in log(N) levels; at each level the arrays are merged in N time, resulting in an overall O(Nlog(N)) performance. 

  * 29 Nov 2018 » [Karatsuba](/pages/algorithms/karatsuba.html) The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast algorithm for multiplying together integers, which beats the standard O(N^2) algorithm by using a recursive divide and conquer design.
