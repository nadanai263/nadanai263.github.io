I used to fly gliders at the Cambridge Gliding Club. Gliders, or sailplanes, are fixed-wing aircraft without engines, and they're typically launched by being pulled by another plane ('aerotow') or from a winch on the ground. A winch launch is quite a spectacular experience the first time you try it: basically, a km-long cable is hooked to the underside of your glider, with the other end attached to a large diesel-powered winch. After an appropriate signal, the winch driver accelerates the engine which spools in the cable. Your glider is accelerated and becomes airborne almost instantaneously. The acceleration is impressive: 0 to 60 kts in around 4-5 seconds. Once in the air, you start a steep climb which (depending on the wind speed that day) finishes between 1-2000 feet. You release the cable at the top, and fly away.

The aim of gliding is to stay in the air using only the help of mother nature. To do this you can climb in thermic columns of rising air; on a fair weather day the tops of these thermals are typically marked by puffy cumulus clouds, so the first strategic thing you learn is to fly under these clouds. In the UK, resonable thermals give you a few kts of upwards velocity, and in fact, on a nice day, it can become quite hard to descend. Elsewhere (far, far from Cambridge) there are hills and mountains, and incident wind on these slopes gives a reliable source of uplift. In any case, once you have found some lift, you are able to relax and enjoy being in the air.

The cockpit of a glider is surrounded by a large transparent canopy which gives excellent visibility all around you (unlike the small portholes of commercial airliners). The most amazing sensation for me is realising how small you are. In the air, everything takes on a more epic proportion. No matter how high you climb, the ground is always there, and seems to grow in size the higher you go, as you can see further and further over the horizon. Cumulus clouds, which look so innocent from the ground, are turbulent and powerful, and their thermals can easily suck a glider right into the middle of a cloud (an undesirable situation as you can then no longer see anything). And when you get close, they take on the appearance of large, fluffy mountains which move. The awesome dynamic energy of clouds is something I never encountered before. 

Eventually you are tired (or somehow manage to lose all the lift), and it's time to land. Situational awareness is all-important when flying, and typically you always know where you are relative to the airfield. It is then a question of managing your glider's energy: you want to be at quite specific speeds and heights relative to the runway. This allows you to enter into a well-rehearsed circuit pattern which leads you to the airfield.
