I am a part-time professional classical pianist, répétiteur, and vocal coach. During a gap year before my PhD (2010-2011) I worked as assistant conductor for [Opera Siam](http://www.operasiam.com), a wonderful opera company (the first!) in Bangkok, where I worked on productions of Carmen and Tosca, and conducted the Thailand premiere of Holst's Savitri. Before that I worked on Madama Butterfly (2007). At university I played for numerous student productions including two versions of Don Giovanni, The Cunning Little Vixen, Le Pauvre Matelot, Pelleas et Melisande, Gianni Schicchi...

I discovered my love for vocal music when I was still a teenager, and performed a number of song cycles including Schumann's Dichterliebe and Liederkreis Op. 39, Schubert's Schwanengesang and Die Schöne Müllerin (which was [recorded](http://www.die-schoene-muellerin.nl/index.php?pag=091&id_rec=216)), Beethoven's An die Ferne Geliebte, French mélodies (Poulenc's La Courte Paille, Fauré Mirages), and countless English songs (Finzi, Earth and Air and Rain, Let Us Garlands Bring, Before and After Summer; Butterworth, A Shropshire Lad). It was my interest in song which led me ultimately to opera.

I also regularly play chamber music and instrumental sonatas; in particular I have extensive experience in accompanying violinists. Although I rarely perform solo today, I have given solo recitals as well as performed concertos by Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky (the latter with the [Siam Philharmonic Orchestra](http://www.operasiam.com/spo/)).
