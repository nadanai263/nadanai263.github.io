description: Is it founded on an engineering approach? Should it be?

I read a very nice review yesterday, written by Prof. Jamie Davies from the University of Edinburgh. It's entitled [Real-world synthetic biology: is it founded on an engineering approach, and should it be?](https://doi.org/10.3390/life9010006). It's a particularly relevant topic at the moment because the first, exploratory phase of synthetic biology is coming to an end. During the period between the early 2000s until today, we have seen an explosion in the successful demonstrations of modifying, or *reverse-engineering*, organisms to carry out new functions. In tinkering with biology, we have not only succeeded in reprogramming cells to produce new drugs and fight cancer, but we've also developed spectacularly powerful tools to read, write, and edit DNA. 

Spurred on by these remarkable advances, and yet recognising the drastic inefficiencies in the current way of working, a large group of scientists in the field (myself included) have come round to the opinion that a *forward-engineering* approach may be more productive for biotechnology in the long run. In this approach, we do not modify a pre-existing organism; rather we build biological function from the ground up, using predictive mathematical models. Forward-engineering approaches are standard practice in most engineering disciplines, and their productivity is exemplified by all engineered systems you see around yourself today, from the smartphone to the aeroplane. Surely it makes sense to try and develop bioengineering into a discipline in which you can predictively design and build a functional, useful product? 

Maybe, but not necessarily, argues Davies. In his review, Davies defines the (broadly accepted) features of the forward-engineering approach. These five elements are:

1. **predictive design**
2. **standard, characterised parts**
3. **modularity and hierarchy**
4. **reliable manufacturing**
5. **standard testing**

In constrast, a quick search of current successful synthetic biology projects (which in this case is defined as having a working commercial application in progress) reveals that out of ten projects, only one of them has adopted some, but not all, of these features. In other words, synthetic biology today uses a reverse-, rather than a forward-, engineering approach. 

What about the future? Davies presents the advantages and disadvantages of each of these features, were they to be actually adopted for bioengineering:

1. Predictive design has the major advantage in saving considerable time and money, as it obviates experimental construction and screening. However the mathematical models required for this require much more complete understanding of the host cell than currently available.
2. Standard parts enable accurate modelling, and enable economy of manufacture and easy maintenence. The final two points are not relevant due to self-replication in biological systems. There are however two interesting disadvantages. The first is the inefficiency of using standard, as opposed to custom, parts. And the second is vulnerability. I hadn't thought of this before, but systems built out of standard parts (for instance, computers on a network) are particularly vulnerable to attacks. While this may seem a way off for synthetic biology, it's definitely worth bearing in mind.
3. Hierarchical, modular design prevents re-inventing the wheel, as well as allows abstraction, enabling work to be carried out on particular subsystems. Modular design, however, exhibits an inefficiency: modules typically contain more functionality than needed. Since cellular resources are limited, maintaining extra functionality may impact the cells' fitness adversely. Secondly, modularity requires insulation of interactions. Insulation is particularly difficult to achieve in biology, and so any advantages conferred here will be less than in conventional engineering.
4. Reliable manufacturing is typically already achieved for biological parts.
5. Standard tests are typically more useful to the community than to individual projects; it might naturally come about through 'cultural feedback', where a community of people who use and benefit from standard parts and components share their knowledge. The creation of such a culture is yet to happen for biology, but in conventional engineering Davies points out that the engineer signs up for a cultural and professional community, in essence becoming a 'standard part' themselves. 

In conclusion, Davies argues that although there are benefits from adopting the forward-engineering approach, these benefits can in some cases be outweighed by the costs: making biology more amenable to engineering is expensive and may only partially pay off. Instead, he sees this rational approach as just one way of carrying out bioengineering. An alternative approach is to harness biology itself, in particular evolution, to do the engineering, for example by carrying out directed-evolution screens for function. Such approaches have also already been adopted in non-biological engineering fields. He warns against allowing the forward-engineering mindset to constrain biological research. 

What do I make of this? For me, as a physicist, the motivation for a bottom-up rational approach is the understanding that it brings. While directed evolution, for instance, may lead to more optimal and useful solutions, it's not controversial to argue that you can learn more by building than by allowing something else to build for you. So while biotechnology should perhaps favour the more practical, although less well-understood approach, I think there is always the case for a more simplified, interpretable method, even if it is for the more self-centered reasons of understanding. 

The major thread through all of the disadvantages of forward-engineering is that of cellular complexity, which makes predictive design hard, and reduces the potential benefits of standardisation and modularity through unknown interactions. While solving this problem is expensive, doing synthetic biology in its entirety in a cell-free system, the approach I take in my own research, shifts the balance somewhat. Cell-free systems offer a simplified environment which, unlike the host cell, may be much more accurately characterised, monitored, and controlled. In this regard it becomes potentially realistic to carry out predictive engineering on these systems. While such an achievement may offer direct benefits to applications involving cell-free systems, it is not obvious that the results will transfer directly back to living cells. 

At the end of the day, the approach taken is a personal choice, guided by personal motivations. The problem of successful bioengineering is complex and difficult enough that it pays to have an open mind.
