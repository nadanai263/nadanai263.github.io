title: "Introduction to Keras"

Keras is a high-level wrapper for Tensorflow and Theano, both of which are powerful machine learning frameworks, and for many people it is their first contact with deep learning. In this first tutorial, I present the most basic introduction to Keras, and develop a code framework which we'll recycle in later tutorials covering more advanced topics. 

Keras provides a quick and easy way to define and train neural network models. It does this by wrapping around powerful frameworks such as Tensorflow and Theano, which are optimised to carry out the linear algebraic computations necessary for machine learning. We won't go into details or theory here; that's the subject of very many excellent tutorials around the web. In this tutorial, I will present the bare-bones code necessary to get a model up and running. We'll iterate over this code framework in subsequent tutorials. But first, let's do some setting up.

The tutorial contains the following sections:

- [1. Getting started](##heading-0)
- [2. Initial authorisation](##heading-1)
* [2.1 Asking for authentication code](###sub-heading-1)
* [2.2 Using the code to get the access token](###sub-heading-2)
- [3. Using the API to make queries](##heading-2)
- [4. Conclusions](##heading-3)

## 1. Getting started
First, we need the following libraries: `keras`, `python-mnist`, `numpy`.
```
pip install keras python-mnist numpy
```
