      <p>I’m taking the Coursera Deep Learning specialisation, also called deeplearning.ai, which is a set of 5 courses meant to give a kick start if you want to try applying deep learning to various problems. So I’ve decided to blog a bit to share my thoughts on the experience. Today I finished the first course, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. It took me about four days of work, and was relatively painless: the most frustrating part was actually getting the online Jupyter notebooks to work, so in the end I made local copies of all the notebooks and finished the assignments there.</p>

<p>I did Andrew Ng’s famous Machine Learning course back in (I think) 2014, although I did not finish the entire thing. My memories from that course were mainly that it was a pain to set up all the linear algebra. As the course was taught using Matlab I had to learn all sorts of Matlab tricks to get it working.</p>

<p>This new Deep Learning course seems to be an evolution of that first course, but with a focus specifically on deep learning (so nothing on more traditional algorithms like SVMs etc.). What is nice though is that since then, running ML projects is becoming easier and easier, especially with powerful frameworks and frontends like tensorflow and keras.</p>

<p>The first course, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, is taught in python and seems to be preparing the groundwork for students to eventually use something like tensorflow. I think this is nice: you should learn the linear algebra once, and make sure you understand it completely. Then you know what is going on ‘under the hood’, as it were. But you then never want to write out all the calculations again, as most of ML development is about designing, refining, and optimising models, and not about linear algebra.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what the course does: it teaches you the step-by-step way of carrying out forward and backpropagation on logistic regression, and then stacks the logistic regression units together into a neural network. The most immediately useful idea I got from the course is to make sure I am completely happy with matrix dimensions. These will be important even when programming using a framework.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to the rest of the specialisation. It seems to be quite a no-nonsense, hands-on approach to deep learning, so I’m interested to see how much I can do after finishing it.</p>
