<p>I used to fly gliders at the Cambridge Gliding Club. Gliders, or sailplanes, are fixed-wing aircraft without engines, and they’re typically launched by being pulled by another plane (‘aerotow’) or from a winch on the ground. A winch launch is quite a spectacular experience the first time you try it: basically, a km-long cable is hooked to the underside of your glider, with the other end attached to a large diesel-powered winch. After an appropriate signal, the winch driver accelerates the engine which spools in the cable. Your glider is accelerated and becomes airborne almost instantaneously. The acceleration is impressive: 0 to 60 kts in around 4-5 seconds. Once in the air, you start a steep climb which (depending on the wind speed that day) finishes between 1-2000 feet. You release the cable at the top, and fly away.</p>

</p>

<p>The aim of gliding is to stay in the air using only the help of mother nature. To do this you can climb in thermic columns of rising air. On a nice summer’s day the tops of these thermals are typically marked by puffy cumulus clouds, so the first strategic thing you learn is to fly under these clouds. In the UK, resonable thermals give you a few kts of upwards velocity, and in fact, on a nice day, it can become quite hard to descend. Elsewhere (far, far from Cambridge) there are hills and mountains, and incident wind on these slopes gives a reliable source of uplift. In any case, once you have found some lift, you are able to relax and enjoy being in the air.</p>

</p>

<p>The cockpit of a glider is surrounded by a large transparent canopy which gives excellent visibility all around you (unlike the small portholes of commercial airliners). The most amazing sensation for me is realising how small you are. In the air, everything takes on a more epic proportion. No matter how high you climb, the ground is always there, and seems to grow in size the higher you go, as you can see further and further over the horizon. Cumulus clouds, which look so innocent from the ground, are turbulent and powerful, and their thermals can easily suck a glider right into the middle of a cloud (an undesirable situation as you can then no longer see anything). And when you get close, you can see and feel their churning and awesome dynamic energy.</p>

</p>

<p>Eventually you are tired (or somehow manage to lose all the lift), and it’s time to land. Situational awareness is all-important when flying, and you are trained to always know where you are relative to the airfield. It is then a question of managing your glider’s energy: you want to be at quite specific speeds and heights relative to the runway. This allows you to enter into a well-rehearsed circuit pattern which leads you to the airfield. Like the space shuttle, you only get one shot at landing, but the way you fly the circuit pattern is directly linked to your landing: you fly it in such a way as to guarantee your ability to set up for an appropriate approach. Such intuitive, airmanship-based flying is a contrast to flying ‘by the numbers’, which may lead pilots blindly into situations they can’t get out of.</p>

<p>The team of BGA instructors at Cambridge were extremely professional, and from day one my training was focused on safety. For me, it was a unique and liberating experience to learn about and manage the inherent risks in glider flying, while pursuing what is frankly an addictive sensation of flying like the birds. If you get the chance, I would definitely recommend taking at least a trial flight, just to see the world from a different perspective.</p>
