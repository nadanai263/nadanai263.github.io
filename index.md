			<p>Welcome! We are a new research group at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>. Led by Dr Nadanai Laohakunakorn, our vision is to master the use of <b>cell-free synthetic biology</b> to enable a wide variety of applications in biomanufacturing, biosensing, and healthcare. </p>
			<p>Harnessing these simplified mimics of living cells gives us a unique approach to understanding life, by building it up from its most basic components. </p>
			<p>Please check back regularly for updates! </p>

<ul>
<p><li>16 January 2023 &#187; We welcome Dev Vaidya to our lab to begin an honours project investigating cell-free enzyme encapsulation, as well as Aarushi Ruhela, a PhD student co-supervised with Jamie Marland, who will study electronic interfaces to cell-free reactions. </li></p>

<p><li>3 October 2022 &#187; At the start of a new academic year, we say goodbye to Paula after a very successful summer project. We welcome <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/people.html">Christoph Wagner</a>, a new PhD student co-supervised with Andrea Weisse's group, who will be working on regenerating cell-free systems. And we congratulate Sahan on publishing his paper on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00244"> phage engineering in cell-free</a>. Lots of good news all around! </li></p>

<p><li>7 July 2022 &#187; Congratulations to Sarah who has published a paper, in collaboration with Ella Thornton, Zoe Gidden, Mathew Horrocks, and Lynne Regan, on a new surface immobilisation technique for cell-free synthesised proteins. Read it <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2022.915035">here</a>! </li></p>

<p><li>4 July 2022 &#187; Our second FLF postdoc, Sahan Liyanagedera, has just started; he'll be working on high-throughput screens of purified cell-free reactions in collaboration with the Edinburgh Genome Foundry. Read more about him <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/people.html">here</a>.</li></p>

<p><li>28 June 2022 &#187; Nadanai gave an interview for BioPOD, the School of Biological Sciences podcast, where he discusses his background, how he became interested in synthetic biology, and his current research in cell-free systems. You can listen to the episode <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/biology-without-the-cells-with-dr-nadanai-laohakunakorn/id1465890427?i=1000567963984/">here.</a> </li></p>

<p><li>20 June 2022 &#187; We welcome Paula Paredes Vergara, an undergraduate student from Glasgow University, who starts a summer internship in our group to work on assembly methods to construct DNA templates for CFPS reactions. </li></p>

<p><li>19 May 2022 &#187; Nadanai gives a talk together with Jane Alexander at the Galvanised seminar series, organised by the Edinburgh Futures Institute. We discuss our <a href="https://www.shorelineofinfinity.com/product/biopolis-tales-of-urban-biology/">Biopolis</a> collaboration and our shared interests in the creative process in science and art. We had a great dicsussion with a very engaged audience. Thank you for the opportunity! </li></p>

<p><li>21 April 2022 &#187; Our first FLF postdoc, Tony Bougas, starts. He will be working on metabolomics of cell-free reactions. You can find out more about him <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/people.html">here</a>.</li></p>

<p><li>13 May 2022 &#187; We say goodbye to Yan Ting, Tim, Katie, and Dominik, who have successfully completed their rotations. We wish them all the best for their future careers.</li></p>

<p><li>6 March 2022 &#187; Nadanai gives a talk at the 4th International Yeditepe University Genetics and Bioengineering Student Congress - sadly online, otherwise it would have been a great trip to Istanbul. Many thanks for the invitation!</li></p> 

<p><li>4 March 2022 &#187; Our new Opentrons arrives. Cue some very excited PhD students. </li></p>

<p><li>24 January 2022 &#187; We have two undergraduate Honours students joining us this term, Yan Ting Hee and Tim Bosse, to work on cell-free protein expression. We are very excited to welcome them into the lab for the first undergraduate wet-lab projects in two years!</li></p>

<p><li>21 January 2022 &#187; A very warm welcome to Sarah Paterson, who has just finished her first week with us. She is a new PhD student working on a Leverhulme-funded project to carry out protein engineering using cell-free systems and microfluidics. Read more about her <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/people.html">here</a>.</li></p> 

<p><li>14 September 2021 &#187; We are advertising two postdoc positions as part of our new UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship programme. One is in machine learning and high-throughput screening, and the other is in synthetic metabolism, both applied to cell-free reactions. Full details and links to apply <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/research.html">here</a>. Please circulate widely!</li></p>

<p><li>8 September 2021 &#187; We are thrilled to announce that Nadanai has been awarded a <b>UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship</b>. This Â£1.5M, 4-year grant will help us kick-start our research into regenerative cell-free systems, and we are very excited to advertise two new postdoctoral positions to work on this project. Read more about the opportunities <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/research.html">here</a>.
