I am an aspiring data scientist with a background in physics, bioengineering, and synthetic biology, who focuses on tackling challenging problems in both fundamental and applied biotechnology. Specifically, I am developing machine learning algorithms for the analysis and interpretation of a wide variety of biological data, in order to acquire knowledge and guide scientific decision-making. I construct pipelines using Python, Keras/Tensorflow, Docker, and AWS to rapidly design, containerize, and train models on the cloud. 

## Data Science Project Portfolio
My portfolio is both a demonstration and a tutorial of specific steps which make up the complete data science process:

### 1. Import - Store - Extract - Organise
### 2. Clean - Transform
### 3. Visualise - Exploration
### 4. Model 
### 5. Interpretation - Communication
