			<p>Welcome! We are a new research group at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>. Led by Dr Nadanai Laohakunakorn, our vision is to master the use of <b>cell-free synthetic biology</b> to enable a wide variety of applications in biomanufacturing, biosensing, and healthcare. </p>
			<p>Harnessing these simplified mimics of living cells gives us a unique approach to understanding life, by building it up from its most basic components. </p>
			<p>Please check back regularly for updates! </p>

<p><li>21 March 2023 &#187; Nadanai gives a talk at the <a href="https://www.munich-iapbp.de/engineering-life">Engineering Life</a> conference at MIAPbP in Munich. It was a very interesting workshop, with plenty of discussions about the big questions in synthetic biology!</li></p>

<p><li>16 January 2023 &#187; We welcome Dev Vaidya to our lab to begin an honours project investigating cell-free enzyme encapsulation, as well as Aarushi Ruhela, a PhD student co-supervised with Jamie Marland in the School of Engineering, who will study electronic interfaces to cell-free reactions. </li></p>

<p><li>3 October 2022 &#187; At the start of a new academic year, we say goodbye to Paula after a very successful summer project. We welcome <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/people.html">Christoph Wagner</a>, a new PhD student co-supervised with Andrea Weisse's group, who will be working on regenerating cell-free systems. And we congratulate Sahan on publishing his paper on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00244"> phage engineering in cell-free</a>. Lots of good news all around! </li></p>

<p><li>7 July 2022 &#187; Congratulations to Sarah who has published a paper, in collaboration with Ella Thornton, Zoe Gidden, Mathew Horrocks, and Lynne Regan, on a new surface immobilisation technique for cell-free synthesised proteins. Read it <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2022.915035">here</a>! </li></p>
