Hi there! I am a scientist with a background in physics, bioengineering, and synthetic biology. I work on cell-free synthetic biology at the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch) in Lausanne, Switzerland. One of my long-term goals is to help bring together experimental synthetic biology and cutting-edge computational techniques, and to this end I have been teaching myself the basics of the exciting and rapidly-moving field of data-driven discovery. This website showcases an expanding collection of diverse computational projects and techniques I have been working on as I make this journey.

Thanks for visiting, and please feel free to get in touch!

#### Data Science Basics

I have been building data science pipelines using Python, Keras/Tensorflow, Docker, and AWS which allows me to rapidly design, containerize, and train machine learning models on the cloud. I've put together a collection of mini projects to serve both a demonstration and a tutorial of specific steps required to do this, and I hope some of the material may be useful to you.

##### 1. Getting the data: Import - Store - Extract - Organise

##### 2. Exploring the data: Clean - Transform - Visualise


##### 3. Modelling the data: Features - Metrics - Algorithms - Optimization - Deployment - Evaluation

##### 4. Learning from the data: Interpretation - Communication

#### Algorithms

In order to familiarise myself with core CS concepts, I have also been implementing various famous algorithms.
