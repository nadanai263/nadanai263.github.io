			<p>Welcome! We are a new research group at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>. Led by Dr Nadanai Laohakunakorn, our vision is to master the use of <b>cell-free synthetic biology</b> to enable a wide variety of applications in biomanufacturing, biosensing, and healthcare. </p>
			<p>Harnessing these simplified mimics of living cells gives us a unique approach to understanding life, by building it up from its most basic components. </p>
			<p>Please check back regularly for updates! </p>
