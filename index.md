Hi there! I am a scientist with a background in physics, bioengineering, and synthetic biology. During the day, I work on experimental cell-free synthetic biology at the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch) in Lausanne, Switzerland, while many of my evenings are spent developing computational models for the analysis and interpretation of a wide variety of data. It is my vision to combine the two, leveraging state-of-the-art computation to enable scientific discovery and guide scientific decision-making.

This website showcases a collection of computational projects and techniques I have been working on as I slowly teach myself the basics of the exciting and rapidly-moving field of data-driven discovery. 

Thanks for visiting, and please feel free to get in touch!

#### Data Science Tutorials

I construct pipelines using Python, Keras/Tensorflow, Docker, and AWS to rapidly design, containerize, and train machine learning models on the cloud, which allows me to interpret and gain insight into large public datasets. I've created an online portfolio to serve both a demonstration and a tutorial of specific steps required to do this, and I hope some of the material may be useful to you.

##### 1. Getting the data: Import - Store - Extract - Organise

##### 2. Exploring the data: Clean - Transform - Visualise


##### 3. Modelling the data: Features - Metrics - Algorithms - Optimization - Deployment - Evaluation

##### 4. Learning from the data: Interpretation - Communication

#### Algorithms

In order to familiarise myself with core CS concepts, I have also been implementing various famous algorithms.
