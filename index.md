Hi there! I'm a scientist and musician based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Here you'll find a collection of links, comments, tutorials, and essays which have accumulated over time about things I find interesting. Some (big) ideas I am grappling with at the moment include:

- How do we most efficiently carry out bioengineering experiments? To make progress in this type of research it seems we need to acquire the maximum information in the least possible time, as design-build-test cycles are predicated on being able to acquire rapid feedback. The intuitive solution is some optimum tradeoff between amount and quality of data. You don't want too much data, which would take too much time; again, if the data quality is high this may require time (or money) to be invested which would slow the cycle. You want the optimum amount and quality of data which enables you to close the design-build-test loop with maximum efficiency. How do we determine this optimum?

- Reducing waste in research: where should you position yourself on the axis between free exploration and optimised, efficient experiments? The former is necessarily wasteful, but may lead to unexpected insights. The latter is least wasteful, but may not yield anything interesting at all, as we are assuming we know what we're going to observe (to a degree). 

- How to best teach physics? In particular, I am an interactive learner. When I see a textbook full of a bunch of equations, I can hardly stop myself from plotting, manipulating, and generally discovering the intuition behind them (always on a computer: I can't do any of these things in my head). I'm thus a big fan of interactive visualisations and demos. However, I also find that just looking at the interactive stuff is not so useful for me: creating the demos myself teaches me the most. Can we come up with some sandbox system for people to play with equations (in a very flexible way), or does something like this already exist? The optimum degree of interactivity for successful learning obviously varies from person to person: can we figure this out and tailor the presentation to each person? 

- In the same vein as interactivity: can we have interactive scientific papers as a norm, rather than an exception? What systems need to be set up so that this can be enabled? Clearly it is a good idea, but clearly it is not realistic for most people today. But lowering the activation energy for this to happen may be easier than most people think. 

- For those who have experienced it, the relevance of great art, music, and literature to people's lives today is undeniably direct and sometimes viscerally so. However this is really not a common viewpoint. How do we encourage more people to live this experience, and allow themselves to be moved by these works? 

- The difference between machine-generated music and human-generated music is that the human work contains (whether subconsciously or by design) a storytelling element. Can we determine and visualise these story arcs in temporal structures such as a musical score? Intuitively, musicians already internalise these structures, but is there any quantitative or automatic way of determining them? Maybe these results can be used to introduce or teach musical concepts.

My day job is as a postdoctoral scientist in the LBNC at EPFL. I also have a second part time job as a musician: I am a pianist and vocal coach and am privileged to work with a number of outstanding musicans on a regular basis. In my spare time I am a fan of the outdoors (in Switzerland we are truly spoilt) and like hiking, skiing, and photography. I used to fly gliders in the UK and hope to again someday.

Please feel free to get in touch!
