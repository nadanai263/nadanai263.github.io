#### Data Science Project Portfolio

Hi there! I am a scientist/aspiring data scientist with a background in physics, bioengineering, and synthetic biology, who focuses on tackling problems in both fundamental and applied biotechnology. During the day, I work on experimental cell-free synthetic biology at the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch) in Lausanne, Switzerland, while many of my evenings are spent developing machine learning algorithms for the analysis and interpretation of a wide variety of biological data. It is my dream to combine the two and leverage state-of-the-art computation to enable scientific discovery and guide scientific decision-making.

I construct pipelines using Python, Keras/Tensorflow, Docker, and AWS to rapidly design, containerize, and train models on the cloud, allowing me to interpret and gain insight into large public datasets. My portfolio is both a demonstration and a tutorial of specific steps required to do this. I hope some of the material may be as useful to you, as it has been for me to create it. 

##### 1. Getting the data: Import - Store - Extract - Organise
##### 2. Exploring the data: Clean - Transform - Visualise
##### 3. Modelling the data: Features - Metrics - Algorithms - Optimization - Deployment - Evaluation
##### 4. Learning from the data: Interpretation - Communication  

Please feel free to get in touch with me!
