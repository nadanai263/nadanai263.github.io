Welcome! We are a new research group at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). Led by Dr Nadanai Laohakunakorn, our vision is to master the use of **cell-free synthetic biology** to enable a wide variety of applications in biomanufacturing, biosensing, and healthcare. 

Harnessing these simplified mimics of living cells gives us a unique approach to understanding life, by building it up from its most basic components. 

Please check back regularly for updates!
