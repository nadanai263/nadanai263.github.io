#### Data Science Projects

Hi there! I am a scientist with a background in physics, bioengineering, and synthetic biology, focusing on tackling problems in both fundamental and applied biotechnology. During the day, I work on experimental cell-free synthetic biology at the [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch) in Lausanne, Switzerland, while many of my evenings are spent developing machine learning algorithms for the analysis and interpretation of a wide variety of biological data. It is my dream to combine the two and leverage state-of-the-art computation to enable scientific discovery and guide scientific decision-making.

I construct pipelines using Python, Keras/Tensorflow, Docker, and AWS to rapidly design, containerize, and train models on the cloud, allowing me to interpret and gain insight into large public datasets. I've put my portfolio online to serve both a demonstration and a tutorial of specific steps required to do this. I hope some of the material may be as useful to you, as it has been for me to create it. 

##### 1. Getting the data: Import - Store - Extract - Organise

##### 2. Exploring the data: Clean - Transform - Visualise


##### 3. Modelling the data: Features - Metrics - Algorithms - Optimization - Deployment - Evaluation

##### 4. Learning from the data: Interpretation - Communication
