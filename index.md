			<p>Welcome! We are a new research group at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>. Led by Dr Nadanai Laohakunakorn, our vision is to master the use of <b>cell-free synthetic biology</b> to enable a wide variety of applications in biomanufacturing, biosensing, and healthcare. </p>
			<p>Harnessing these simplified mimics of living cells gives us a unique approach to understanding life, by building it up from its most basic components. </p>
			<p>Please check back regularly for updates! </p>

	<p><li>24 Mar 2020 &#187; Although our wet lab is closed, we are making good progress with remote work. Our comprehensive review on cell-free, with collaborators from <a href="http://lbnc.epfl.ch/">LBNC</a>, has just been <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00213">published</a> today. We wish everyone all the best during these challenging times! </li></p>
	<p><li>20 Jan 2020 &#187; A very warm welcome to Maria and Baird, two undergraduates joining the lab for their senior honours projects! Read more about them in the <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/people.html">People</a> section.</li></p>
	<p><li>05 Jan 2020 &#187; Thank you to everyone who applied for the PhD projects. We will be in touch shortly. </li></p>
	<p><li>23 Dec 2019 &#187; <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3591963">Preprint</a> online for our new review of cell-free synbio, just in time for the holidays! Have a great break everyone, and looking forward to the new year.</li></p>
  <p><li>11 Dec 2019 &#187; It's the end-of-year conference season! Nadanai presented his work at <a href="https://www.eventsforce.net/biochemsoc/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=22575&eventID=52&traceRedir=2">SBUK 2019</a> in Warwick, and the <a href="https://www.aiche.org/sbe/conferences/cell-free-systems-conference/2019">Cell Free Systems Conference</a> in Boston. </li></p>
