			<p>Welcome! We are a new research group at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>. Led by Dr Nadanai Laohakunakorn, our vision is to master the use of <b>cell-free synthetic biology</b> to enable a wide variety of applications in biomanufacturing, biosensing, and healthcare. </p>
			<p>Harnessing these simplified mimics of living cells gives us a unique approach to understanding life, by building it up from its most basic components. </p>
			<p>Please check back regularly for updates! </p>

<ul>
<p><li>18 Apr 2024 &#187; Congratulations to Surendra who just presented his PhD work at the <a href="https://syncell2024.sciencesconf.org/?lang=en">SynCell 2024</a> conference in Toulouse, France.</li></p>

<p><li>14 Apr 2024 &#187; Michael's preprint on applying machine learning to study physiochemical properties of natural and engineered proteins is now out on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.10.588835">bioRxiv</a>. A great collaboration with the <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/doyarzun/">Oyarz√∫n</a> and <a href="https://www.wellswoodresearchgroup.com/">Wells Wood</a> groups!</li></p>

<p><li>15 Jan 2024 &#187; We welcome Ryan Lee, visiting PhD student from the <a href="https://choulab.netlify.app/">Chou lab</a> in Toronto, and Paula Juve, undergraduate honours student, who are both starting their projects in the lab today.</li></p>

<p><li>23 Aug 2023 &#187; Nadanai has just returned from the <a href="https://biogate.itu.edu.tr/">BioGate</a> competition, impressively hosted by students at the Istanbul Technical University.</li></p>

<p><li>21 Aug 2023 &#187; Big congratulations to Junming and Matthew for finishing their MSc and Hons projects respectively. We enjoyed working with them and wish them all the best for their future careers.</li></p>

<p><li>29 May 2023 &#187; Another warm welcome to Matthew Hardcastle, who will join the lab to work on acid-stressed cell-free systems for his honours project.</li></p>

<p><li>1 May 2023 &#187; We welcome Junming Li to start her MSc in our lab, continuing on Dev's excellent work involving encapsulated enzymes in cell-free systems.</li></p>

<p><li>22 April 2023 &#187; We had fine weather for our group hike at the Hermitage in Dunkeld:</li></p>

<p><li>21 March 2023 &#187; Nadanai gives a talk at the <a href="https://www.munich-iapbp.de/engineering-life">Engineering Life</a> conference at MIAPbP in Munich. It was a very interesting workshop, with plenty of discussions about the big questions in synthetic biology!</li></p>

<p><li>16 January 2023 &#187; We welcome Dev Vaidya to our lab to begin an honours project investigating cell-free enzyme encapsulation, as well as Aarushi Ruhela, a PhD student co-supervised with Jamie Marland in the School of Engineering, who will study electronic interfaces to cell-free reactions. </li></p>

<p><li>3 October 2022 &#187; At the start of a new academic year, we say goodbye to Paula after a very successful summer project. We welcome <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/people.html">Christoph Wagner</a>, a new PhD student co-supervised with Andrea Weisse's group, who will be working on regenerating cell-free systems. And we congratulate Sahan on publishing his paper on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00244"> phage engineering in cell-free</a>. Lots of good news all around! </li></p>

<p><li>7 July 2022 &#187; Congratulations to Sarah who has published a paper, in collaboration with Ella Thornton, Zoe Gidden, Mathew Horrocks, and Lynne Regan, on a new surface immobilisation technique for cell-free synthesised proteins. Read it <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2022.915035">here</a>! </li></p>
