			<p>Welcome! We are a new research group at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>. Led by Dr Nadanai Laohakunakorn, our vision is to master the use of <b>cell-free synthetic biology</b> to enable a wide variety of applications in biomanufacturing, biosensing, and healthcare. </p>
			<p>Harnessing these simplified mimics of living cells gives us a unique approach to understanding life, by building it up from its most basic components. </p>
			<p>Please check back regularly for updates! </p>

	<p><li>3 Aug 2020 &#187; We are recruiting! We have a 4-year fully-funded <a href="http://www.eastscotbiodtp.ac.uk/">EASTBIO</a> PhD position available for a project entitled 'Scalable cell-free manufacturing of diverse therapeutic proteins'. The project aims to develop strategies to produce important therapeutic proteins at the industrial scale, and will be in close collaboration with <a href="https://fujifilmdiosynth.com/">Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies</a>. This position is open to UK as well as EU students already resident in the UK for 3 years. More information can be found <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/research.html">here</a>. You can apply directly on the graduate school website <a href="https://apps.bio.ed.ac.uk/pgr/checklist/project/1014">here</a>. The deadline is 24th August.</li></p>
	<p><li>24 Jul 2020 &#187; A second publication for this summer is out: this time, Nadanai's short <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00788">perspectives piece</a> on rational biodesign with cell-free systems.</li></p>
	<p><li>4 Jul 2020 &#187; We just published a new <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.185900">preprint</a> on self-regenerating cell-free systems, in collaboration with <a href="http://lbnc.epfl.ch/">LBNC</a>. </li></p>
	<p><li>25 May 2020 &#187; Many congratulations to Maria and Baird for completing their Honours projects! </li></p>
	<p><li>18 May 2020 &#187; We welcome Ying, Yehezkiel, and Yutong, who are joining for their MSci projects, which at this time are all remotely-supervised computational studies. Read their profiles in the <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/people.html">People</a> section.</li></p>
