Hi there! I'm a scientist and musician based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Here you'll find a growing and diverse collection of links, comments, tutorials, and essays about things I find interesting. I'm learning to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and this site is the result of that foray. It will also document my exploration of ideas in scientific computing, Bayesian techniques, and machine learning. 

 Some (big) ideas I am grappling with at the moment include:

- How do we make biology more engineerable? The topic of my research at [LBNC](http://lbnc.epfl.ch). In particular, to what extent can the distributed complexity of evolved systems be abstracted into a form which enables human understanding and predictive modelling? To what extent do we have to simplify biology to make it amenable to rational engineering? 

- How do we learn governing equations from data? Inspired by [Nathan Kutz](https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/). Can we do this in a Bayesian way?

- Can we have interactive scientific papers as standard? What about interactive news articles? Inspired by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com).

- Can we discover good digital representations of music? Can a model learn large scale structures in music? I am impressed by the approaches taken in the [Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab](https://dcml.epfl.ch) at EPFL.

- How do we make classical music more relevant for people who consider it inaccessible? What about opera?

My day job is as a postdoctoral scientist in the [LBNC](http://lbnc.epfl.ch) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/index.en.html). I also have a second part time job as a musician: I am a pianist and vocal coach and am privileged to work with a number of outstanding musicans on a regular basis. In my spare time I am a fan of the outdoors and like running, hiking, skiing, and photography. I used to fly gliders in the UK and hope to again someday.

Please feel free to get in touch!
