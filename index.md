Hi there! I am a scientist with a background in physics, bioengineering, and synthetic biology. I work on [cell-free synthetic biology](http://lbnc.epfl.ch/) at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). One of my long-term goals is to bring together experimental and computational techniques to serve synthetic biology, and to this end I have been teaching myself the basics of data-driven methods and machine learning. This personal website is an attempt to consolidate various techniques, tips, and tricks I have come across as I dive into this field. It also contains a general blog of thoughts and ideas I find interesting.

Thanks for visiting, and please feel free to get in touch!

#### Data Science Basics

I have been building data science pipelines using Python, Keras/Tensorflow, Docker, and AWS which allows me to rapidly design, containerize, and train machine learning models on the cloud. I've put together a collection of mini-demonstrations to show the specific steps involved. As the field is changing very quickly, the demos presented here may rapidly become obsolete. Correctness is by no means guaranteed, but I will be extremely grateful if you do point out any glaring errors.

#### Algorithms and Data Structures

In order to familiarise myself with core CS concepts, I have also been implementing various algorithms and data structures. These aren't likely to become obsolete any time soon.

#### How-to

I've also compiled general notes on how to do things. These are typically unformatted and purely for my own reference.
