I am an aspiring data scientist with a background in physics, bioengineering, and synthetic biology, who focuses on tackling challenging problems in both fundamental and applied biotechnology. Specifically, I am developing machine learning algorithms for the analysis and interpretation of a wide variety of biological data, in order to acquire knowledge and guide scientific decision-making. I construct pipelines using Python, Keras/Tensorflow, Docker, and AWS to rapidly design, containerize, and train models on the cloud. 


#### Data Science Project Portfolio
My portfolio is both a demonstration and a tutorial of specific steps which make up the complete data science process. I hope it 

##### 1. Getting the data: Import - Store - Extract - Organise
* [Getting data from Twitter](/_posts/2018-11-14-Using Python to scrape Twitter data.html)

##### 2. Exploring the data: Clean - Transform - Visualise
##### 3. Modelling the data: Features - Metrics - Algorithms - Optimization - Deployment - Evaluation
##### 4. Learning from the data: Interpretation - Communication
