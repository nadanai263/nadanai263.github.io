<p>Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing field set to make profound impact in numerous industries including manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and sustainable energy, as well as our fundamental understanding of life itself. However, engineering synthetic biological systems reliably has proven to be a tremendously challenging task.</p>

<p>One promising approach is to use cell-free gene expression systems. These are <em>in vitro</em> systems that mimic the cellular environment and can be integrated with microfluidic technologies to rapidly prototype and screen synthetic gene circuits, prior to their deployment <em>in vivo</em>. This speeds up the synthetic biology design cycle, but also perhaps more powerfully, releases gene expression from the confines of the cell. In this way, the cell-free extracts themselves can be viewed as functional liquids, programmed by DNA.</p>

<p><strong>The aim of our research is to harness these <em>in vitro</em> biomolecular mechanisms in a controlled and quantitative manner.</strong></p>

<p>The consequence of this approach is twofold: the first is a deeper understanding of life, as we attempt to control and manipulate genetic and metabolic systems which have been crafted over billions of years of evolution. The second is the development of powerful cell-free applications which, unlike synthetic cellular systems, are not limited by the strict requirements to maintain life.</p>

<h3>PhD Opportunities</h3>

<p><strong>4-year, fully-funded EASTBIO studentship - â€˜Cell-free synthetic biology: selection without cellsâ€™</strong>. Co-supervised with <a href="http://regan.bio.ed.ac.uk">Prof Lynne Regan</a>. Application deadline: 6 January 2021. Apply directly <a href="https://apps.bio.ed.ac.uk/pgr/checklist/project/1079">here</a>.</p>

<p>Cell-free transcription/translation provides a means to produce proteins, and to screen for activities that would not be possible with live cells. We combine protein design and synthetic biology with novel surface engineering nanotechnology methods to implement exciting new cell-free activity screens. In this project the student will set up and execute cell-free transcription/translation employing also the nanobiology of self-assembling surfaces. The student will use the cell-free system to develop screens to identify proteins with novel activities. The student will be guided by mentors whose complementary expertise spans the entire range of the project, and beyond. This interdisciplinary PhD project will equip the student with expertise in key areas of modern biology, biotechnology, synthetic biology and quantitative biology. The successful student will be equally well-prepared for a career in academia or industry. The student will be based in a vibrant laboratory that is shared by the groups of the two mentors and also by the groups of two PIs with expertise in chemical biotechnology and computational biology. The student will also be a member of the renowned Edinburgh Centre for Synthetic and Systems Biology, which provides both a stimulating intellectual environment and a wealth of practical expertise. The student will have a variety of opportunities to hone their presentation skills and to present in both focused and more general seminar settings. We are passionate about communicating science to the broader community, and the student will have many opportunities to participate in such activities in creative ways. The successful student will have an undergraduate degree in the biological, physical or engineering sciences. Their undergraduate degree will be at least a 2:1 or the equivalent. Students with masterâ€™s degrees in appropriate areas are also encouraged to apply.</p>

<p>This 4 year PhD project is part of a competition funded by EASTBIO BBSRC Doctoral Training Partnership. This opportunity is open to UK and international students and provides funding to cover stipend and UK level tuition fees. The fee difference will be covered by the University of Edinburgh for successful international applicants.

<p><strong>Re-energising the PURE system</strong>. Application deadline: 6 January 2021. Apply directly <a href="https://apps.bio.ed.ac.uk/pgr/checklist/project/1047">here</a>.</p>

<p>Cell-free gene expression systems composed of purified, reconstituted components (e.g. the PURE system) enable the operation of well-defined protein synthesis reactions. These systems are used in many applications, from directed evolution of enzymes to powering synthetic cells. However, their low efficiency and lifetime compared to conventional lysate-based cell-free extracts limits their biotechnological potential.</p>

<p>This project aims to develop strategies to improve the performance of reconstituted cell-free systems. These systems will be produced in-house using a newly-developed protocol, before being combined with novel techniques for regeneration of biochemical energy and maintenance of reaction homeostasis.</p>

<p>The successful candidate will have a strong experimental background in molecular biology/biochemistry. It is desirable that they also have interests in cell-free technologies, bioenergetics, and metabolic engineering. Please contact <a href="mailto:nadanai.laohakunakorn@ed.ac.uk">Nadanai</a> directly to discuss funding opportunities.</p>
