			<p>Welcome! We are a new research group at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>. Led by Dr Nadanai Laohakunakorn, our vision is to master the use of <b>cell-free synthetic biology</b> to enable a wide variety of applications in biomanufacturing, biosensing, and healthcare. </p>
			<p>Harnessing these simplified mimics of living cells gives us a unique approach to understanding life, by building it up from its most basic components. </p>
			<p>Please check back regularly for updates! </p>

	<p><li>21 July 2021 &#187; Our microfluidics setup is ready to go, and we are now advertising a Leverhulme Trust funded PhD project to bring it to fruition. Please see the <a href="/pages/research.html">project description</a> for more details.</li></p>

	<p><li>21 June 2021 &#187; Summer is here, and with it a change of personnel and activities. We say goodbye to Sasirasa and Bastien, and welcome <a href="/pages/people.html">Dominik</a>, who has been awarded an EPSRC undergraduate vacation internship to work with us for the next couple of months.</li></p>

	<p><li>10 May 2021 &#187; We welcome Meijie who is joining us as a new MSc student this summer. Read all about her <a href="/pages/people.html">here</a>.</li></p>

	<p><li>15 Mar 2021 &#187; A new studentship has just been advertised as part of the IBioIC CTP programme, between ours and Chris French's <a href="http://frenchlab.bio.ed.ac.uk">lab</a>, and in collaboration with the Scotch Whisky Research Institute. The aim is to develop cell-free biosensors to monitor whisky quality. Funding is available for UK or EU students resident in the UK for 3 years prior to start of studentship. More info and apply <a href="https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/development-of-biosensor-technology-for-the-measurement-and-control-of-off-note-flavours-in-the-scotch-whisky-industry/?p130850">here</a> by the deadline of 9th April 2021.  </li></p>

	<p><li>11 Mar 2021 &#187; Nadanai is back at SynthSys to present at the Open Centre Meeting, on self-regeneration in cell-free systems.</li></p>

	<p><li>8 Feb 2021 &#187; We are very excited to be supporting the new International Directed Evolution Competition (<a href="https://idec.io/">IDEC</a>), which aims to harness irrational design to complement existing rational design efforts for engineering biology. Find out more information, and how you can take part, at their website. </li></p>
